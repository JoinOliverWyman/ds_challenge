# Oliver Wyman Data Analyst Interview Task
Please submit the result as a Github project. You could find a description and all necessary data for each part of the challenge in the corresponding directory.  
*Maximum time to complete the task: 7 days.*

The main goal of this challenge is to build a model to predict the probability of default (financial term describing the likelihood that a borrower will be unable to meet its debt obligations). This task contains the following sections:
* Part 1 ‐ Exploratory data analysis
* Part 2 ‐ Experiment and metrics design
* Part 3 ‐ Predictive modeling
* Additional Task

## Execution format
All parts could be executed in IPython Notebook (one or multiple as you prefer). However, you can earn additional points by fitting the prediction pipeline of a final model in a class with methods 'read_data', 'transform_data' and 'predict'. The example is in 'Additional Task' directory.

##### Good luck
