# Oliver Wyman Data Analyst Interview Task
Please submit the result as a Github project. You could find a description and all necessary data for each part of the challenge in the corresponding directory. A detailed design of the repository is welcome: completed read.me, related files saved in the appropriate format, code readability, comments. Please note that we should be able to reproduce your code and get the same result.  
*Maximum time to complete the task: 7 days.*

The main goal of this challenge is to build a model to predict the probability of default (financial term describing the likelihood that a borrower will be unable to meet its debt obligations). This task contains the following sections:
* Part 1 ‐ Exploratory data analysis
  This part of the task assumes efficient json processing as well as applied EDA with an explanation of   what methods of exploring the data are used and what conclusions can be     drawn from this analysis.
* Part 2 ‐ Experiment and metrics design
  The following part of the task is devoted to the choice of methods for evaluating the quality of the     model. It's worth providing a detailed justification of the chosen         metric, taking into account all the   advantages and disadvantages of it's application to the stated problem.
* Part 3 ‐ Predictive modeling
  The last part of the task is dedicated to building a predictive model. It is expected that feature       engineering, feature selection, model selection and model tunning         techniques will be demonstrated in     this part of the task with description of the result obtained, the advantages and disadvantages of the   final model, possible steps to     improve it.
* Additional Task

## Execution format
All parts could be executed in IPython Notebook in reproducable way. However, you can earn additional points by fitting the prediction pipeline of a final model in a class with methods 'read_data', 'transform_data' and 'predict'. The example is in 'Additional Task' directory.

##### Good luck !
